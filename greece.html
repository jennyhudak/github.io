  <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>The beautiful Mediterranean country of Greece has a long and
        rich economic, global and cultural history. With a booming tourism
        industry and long history, it has become a destination for many. Greece
        achieved independence from the Ottoman Empire in
        <time datetime="1830">1830</time>.</p>
      <p>During the second half of the 19th century, Greece gradually added
        neighboring islands and territories, most with Greek-speaking
        populations. In World War II, Greece was first
        invaded by Italy and subsequently occupied by Germany; fighting endured
        in a protracted civil war between supporters of the king and other
        anti-communist and communist rebels.</p>
      <p>In <time datetime="1949">1949</time>,Greece joined NATO.
        In <time datetime="1967">1967</time>, a group of
        military officers seized power, establishing a military dictatorship
        that suspended many political liberties and forced the king to flee the
        country. Following the collapse of the dictatorship, democratic
        elections and a referendum created a parliamentary republic and
        abolished the monarchy. In <time datetime="1981">1981</time>,
        Greece joined the EC (now the EU); it became the 12th member of the
        European Economic and Monetary Union (EMU)
        in <time datetime="2001">2001</time>.</p>
      <p>Greece has suffered a severe economic crisis since
        late <time datetime="2009">2009</time>, due to nearly a
        decade of chronic overspending and structural rigidities.
        Greece then entered three bailout agreements - with the European
        Commission, the European Central Bank (ECB), the IMF, and the third
        in <time datetime="2015">2015</time> with the European Stability
        Mechanism (ESM) - worth in total about $300 billion. The Greek
        Government formally exited the third bailout
        in <time datetime="2018-08">August 2018</time>.</p>
      <p>On this page, we will explore some of the geographical, economic and
        communication aspects of Greece.</p>

  <h3>Economic Overview</h3>
      <p>Greece has a capitalist economy with a public sector accounting for
        about 40% of GDP and with per capita GDP about two-thirds that of the
        leading euro-zone economies. Tourism provides a whopping 18% of GDP.
        Immigrants make up nearly one-fifth of the work force, mainly in
        agricultural jobs. Greece is a major beneficiary of EU aid, equal
        to about 3.3% of annual GDP.</p>
      <p>Still, the Greek economy has faced much turmoil in recent years. In
        <time datetime="2017">2017</time>, Greece saw improvements in GDP and
        unemployment. Unfinished economic reforms, a massive non-performing
        loan problem, and ongoing uncertainty regarding the political direction
        of the country hold the economy back.</p>
  <h3>Real GDP</h3>
      <p>Gross domestic product (GDP) is the total monetary or market value of
        all the finished goods and services produced within a country’s
        borders in a specific time period. This is a broad indicator of the
        overall domestic production, it functions as a comprehensive look
        at a given country’s economic health. In recent years, Greece's GDP
        has fluctuated slighly.</p>

    <h3>Telecommunication systems</h3>
      <p>Due to the volatile economy in Greece, the nation's telecom market
        is fairly susceptible. Confidence has been renewed through foreign and
        European investments; increasing urban population with well-developed
        mobile market; growing adoption of technology; steady development
        of broadband; investment in LTE and launch of 5G; government project
        for ultra-fast broadband, largely funded by European Commission with
        focus on underserved areas. </p><!--Source: CIA World Factbook-->

        nationwide, the country operates one government-owned TV channel with
        national coverage; three privately owned satellite channels;
        multi-channel satellite and cable TV services available;
        upwards of 1,500 radio stations, all of them privately owned; and
        two government-owned broadcaster radio stations. </p>
