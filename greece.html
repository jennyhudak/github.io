    <h1>Introduction</h1>
        <p>The beautiful Mediterranean country of Greece has a long and
          rich economic, global and cultural history. With a booming tourism
          industry and long history, it has become a destination for many. Greece
          achieved independence from the Ottoman Empire in
          <time datetime="1830">1830</time>.</p>
        <p>During the second half of the 19th century, Greece gradually added
          neighboring islands and territories, most with Greek-speaking
          populations. In World War II, Greece was first
          invaded by Italy and subsequently occupied by Germany; fighting endured
          in a protracted civil war between supporters of the king and other
          anti-communist and communist rebels.</p>
        <p>In <time datetime="1949">1949</time>,Greece joined NATO.
          In <time datetime="1967">1967</time>, a group of
          military officers seized power, establishing a military dictatorship
          that suspended many political liberties and forced the king to flee the
          country. Following the collapse of the dictatorship, democratic
          elections and a referendum created a parliamentary republic and
          abolished the monarchy. In <time datetime="1981">1981</time>,
          Greece joined the EC (now the EU); it became the 12th member of the
          European Economic and Monetary Union (EMU)
          in <time datetime="2001">2001</time>.</p>
        <p>Greece has suffered a severe economic crisis since
          late <time datetime="2009">2009</time>, due to nearly a
          decade of chronic overspending and structural rigidities.
          Greece then entered three bailout agreements - with the European
          Commission, the European Central Bank (ECB), the IMF, and the third
          in <time datetime="2015">2015</time> with the European Stability
          Mechanism (ESM) - worth in total about $300 billion. The Greek
          Government formally exited the third bailout
          in <time datetime="2018-08">August 2018</time>.</p>
        <p>On this page, we will explore some of the geographical, economic and
          communication aspects of Greece.</p>

          <p>Greece's mountainous terrain spans across much of the coutnry.
            With ranges extending into the sea as peninsulas or chains of islands,
            several of Greece's cities exist sloped along the coasts. Greece's
            highest point is Mount Olympus, standing at 2,917 meters high.</p>

    <h3>Economic Overview</h3>
        <p>Greece has a capitalist economy with a public sector accounting for
          about 40% of GDP and with per capita GDP about two-thirds that of the
          leading euro-zone economies. Tourism provides a whopping 18% of GDP.
          Immigrants make up nearly one-fifth of the work force, mainly in
          agricultural jobs. Greece is a major beneficiary of EU aid, equal
          to about 3.3% of annual GDP.</p>
        <p>Still, the Greek economy has faced much turmoil in recent years. In
          <time datetime="2017">2017</time>, Greece saw improvements in GDP and
          unemployment. Unfinished economic reforms, a massive non-performing
          loan problem, and ongoing uncertainty regarding the political direction
          of the country hold the economy back.</p>

  <div class="grid-item">
    <h3>Real GDP</h3>
        <p>Gross domestic product (GDP) is the total monetary or market value of
          all the finished goods and services produced within a country’s
          borders in a specific time period. This is a broad indicator of the
          overall domestic production, it functions as a comprehensive look
          at a given country’s economic health. In recent years, Greece's GDP
          has fluctuated slighly.</p>

    <h3>Inflation Rate</h3>
        <p>Inflation is the rate of increase in prices over a given period of
          time. Inflation is typically a broad measure, such as the overall
          increase in prices or the increase in the cost of living in a country.
        </p>
        <p>Greece's inflation rate over the previous three years dwindled,
          indicating their economic market was slowly stabilizing. While this
          number could fluctuate at any given moment based on various factors, a
          steady decrease in inflation rates is typically a good indicator.</p>
