    <h1>Welcome to my portfolio!</h1>
        <p>Hi! My name is Jenny. I am a 2nd year master's degree student studying
          public relations at the University of Miami. I was born and raised
          right here in Miami. While I am still a full-time student, I work
          partime in the University's Communications department as a news
          writer and photographer. For fun, I like to watch football, run,
          cook, and hang out with my dogâ€”Taylor (aptly named for Taylor Swift).</p>
        <p>While I mainly enjoy photography, I also dabble in writing and video.
          Take a look at my work below! </p>
