<h1>Jenny Hudak 👋🏼</h1>
<p>Hi! My name is Jenny. I am a 2nd year master's degree student studying public relations at the University of Miami. I was born and raised right here in Miami.</p>

<h1>What Do I Do? 🤔</h1>
<p><b>Great question!</b> While I am still a full-time student, I work partime in the University's Communications department as a news writer and photographer. For fun, I like to watch football, run, cook, and hang out with my dog—Taylor (aptly named for Taylor Swift). </p>
<h2>Photography 📸</h2>
<p>I started taking photos when I was in middle school. It has since turned in to a hobby and part time career. You can check out some of my work <a href="jennyhudak.com">HERE!</a> Here's a few of my favorite collections:</p>

  <h2>Running 🏃🏽‍♀️</h2>
<p>About five years ago, I began running as a pastime. I have since run 7 half-marathons. I hope to one day run a full marathon. You can catch me at the finish line of the Miami (half) Marathon this weekend!</p>
<h2>Cooking 👩🏼‍🍳</h2>
<p>Over the years, I've developed a strong passion for cooking (and eating!). I am particularly interested in Mediterranean cuisine and make a great Greek gyro! I'd love to one day visit the country. Here's a break down of my favorite meals:</p>
