      <h1>Who Am I?</h1>
<p>Hi! My name is Jenny Hudak. I am a 2nd year master's degree student studying
  public relations at the University of Miami. I was born and raised right here
  in Miami.</p>

<h1>What Do I Do </h1>
<p>Great question! While I am still a full-time student, I work parttime in the
  University's Communications department as a news writer and photographer.
  For fun, I like to long distane run, cook, and hang out with my dogâ€”Taylor
  (aptly named for Taylor Swift). </p>

  <h2>Photography</h2>
  <p>I started taking photos when I was in middle school. It has since turned
  in to a hobby and part time career. You can check out some of my work

  <h2>Running</h2>
  <p>About five years ago, I began running as a pastime. I have since run 7
  half-marathons. I hope to one day run a full marathon. You can catch me at the
  finish line of the Miami (half) Marathon this weekend!</p>
