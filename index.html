<h2> Who am I?</h2>
Hi! My name is Jenny Hudak. I am a 2nd year master's degree student studying public relations at the University of Miami. I was born and raised right here in Miami.

<h2>What Do I Do </h2>
Great question! While I am still a full-time student, I work parttime in the University's Communications 
department as a news writer and photographer. For fun, I like to long distane run, 
cook, and hang out with my dogâ€”Taylor (aptly named for Taylor Swift).
